        Kangaroos are large marsupials that are found only in Australia. They are identified by their muscular 
        tails, strong back legs, <br>
        large feet, short fur and long, pointed ears. Like all marsupials, a sub-type of mammal, females have pouches
         that contain mammary glands,<br>
          where their young live until they are old enough to emerge.

    <h2>Size</h2>
    <p>The largest kangaroo, as well as the largest marsupial, is the red kangaroo, according to
        <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/red-kangaroo"> National Geographic.</a> The length 
            from the red kangaroo's head <br>
            to its rump is 3.25 to 5.25 feet (1 to 1.6 meters) long. Its tail adds another 
            35.5 to 43.5 inches (90 to 110 centimeters)
         to its length and its entire body weighs around <br>
         200 lbs. (90 kilograms).</p>
         
         <h2>Habits</h2>
         <p>Kangaroos are the only large animals that hop as a primary means of locomotion. Their springy hind legs and 
             feet are much stronger and larger than their arms (or "forelimbs"). <br>
             According to the San Diego Zoo, kangaroos
              can cover 15 feet (7 m) in a single 
             hop and can hop as fast as 30 mph (48 kph). Usually, 20 mph (32 kph) is considered 
             their<br>
              cruising speed. When feeding, kangaroos use a slower, walking movement, and for that
              they use their muscular tail as a kind of fifth leg, pushing off the ground as they move along.<br>


            Kangaroos are social and live in groups called a mob, a herd or a troop. Kangaroos in a mob will
             groom each other and protect each other from danger. If a kangaroo suspects<br>
              there is danger in the area,
              it will stomp its foot on the ground to alert others. If it comes to blows, a kangaroo will box and kick its
               opponent. </p>
               
               <h2>Diet</h2>
               <p>Kangaroos are herbivores. They eat grasses, flowers, leaves, ferns, moss and even insects. Like cows,
                    kangaroos regurgitate their 
                   food and re-chew it before it is ready to be totally digested. </p>


<br>
<h2>Boxing</h2>
<h5> Kangaroo are very good boxers. That is the most amusing thing about kangaroos.<br>
    During a "boxing" bout, a kangaroo can actually balance his entire body on his tail,<br> kicking forward with his powerful legs.</h5>
